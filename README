To convert packages/* repositories from PLD CVS to git run:

    ./pld-git.sh

Conversion of CVS repos to git is done in the following steps.

1. The modified version of cvs2git is cloned from github

2. rsync is used to make a local copy of CVS repo

   If REMOVE_BINARIES is set to yes (it is the default now) the binary files
   that are not present on HEAD are excluded. For an exact pattern of excluded
   files see binary_patterns file.

3. The packages that have changed from last rsync are converted. For
   conversion a modified version of cvs2git is used. 

   Modifications to cvs2git:
   
   a. the algorithm to determine the parent branch of the given commit
      is changed to give trunk smaller priority
   b. the information about CVS revisions of changed files is added to
      commit messages

4. The new git repos are tweaked. For details see header of cvs2git_fixes.sh
